# Simple Interest Calculator

 Description
This project is a **Simple Interest Calculator** that calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic financial calculation using simple logic. It is useful for beginners learning programming and understanding interest calculations.

 How It Works
The calculator takes the following inputs:
- **Principal (P)** – The initial amount of money
- **Rate (R)** – Annual interest rate (in %)
- **Time (T)** – Time period (in years)

It then computes and displays the simple interest.

 Example
If:
- Principal = 1000  
- Rate = 5%  
- Time = 2 years  

Then:
